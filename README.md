# marketing-analytics
Projects from Udacitys Marketing Analytics program. 
In the program I analyzed data, modeled marketing scenarios, and communicated findings with Excel, Tableau, Google Analytics, and Data Studio. 
In this project I cleaned and analysed a large survey dataset, a real dataset from a Udacity survey.
