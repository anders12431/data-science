# marketing-analytics
Projects from Udacitys Marketing Analytics program.

In this branch are projects I made in Tableau. For a better look at my visualisations, please visit my publich Tableau profile: https://public.tableau.com/profile/anders.enochsson#!/vizhome/Udacitybuilddatadashbords1/Dashboardvisualization1
