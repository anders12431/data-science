# marketing-analytics
Projects from Udacitys Marketing Analytics program. 
In the program I analysed data, modelled marketing scenarios, and communicated findings with Excel, Tableau, Google Analytics, and Data Studio. 
You will find a project I made in Tableau here. The projected consisted of cleaning flights data from Kaggle and making visualizations. 
I posted the original flights data, as well as the cleaned flights data, .png images of screenshots of my public Tableau profile with the finished visualizations.  

For a better look at the visualizations, please visit my public Tableau profile: https://public.tableau.com/profile/anders.enochsson#!/vizhome/Udacitybuilddatadashbords1/Dashboardvisualization1
